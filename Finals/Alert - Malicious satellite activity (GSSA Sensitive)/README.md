# Alert - Malicious satellite activity (GSSA Sensitive):

Several days ago, an aging satellite owned by the now defunct LaunchDotCom company was mentioned on Twitter as having been hacked by an adversary. The adversary Twitter proxies say they are retaliating against economic embargos and will cripple more of our satellites if we do not ease sanctions. Mission Operations Centers (MOC) in charge of flying these satellites had noticed nothing out of the ordinary until a few hours ago when this satellite appeared to garble commands and randomly gimble and tumble upon receiving commands. The MOC operators are attempting to discover the root cause for these anomalies by probing the spacecraft in safe mode and sending specially crafted command messages to check memory contents.  Recently they lost complete access to the ground segment software and are thus unable to perform any further recovery actions.
Mission Hack-A-Sat:
We need your help to answer the call and prove you have what it takes to regain control of this rogue satellite. Cash rewards are up for grabs for those who can mitigate this malicious activity and demonstrate full control of the satellite. Your first challenge: Recover the Ground Station.
