Back to Scoreboard

Included is the simulation code for the attitude control loop for a satellite in orbit. A code reviewer said I made a pretty big mistake that could allow a star tracker to misbehave. Although my code is flawless, I put in some checks to make sure the star tracker can't misbehave anyways.

Review the simulation I have running to see if a startracker can still mess with my filter. Oh, and I'll be giving you the attitude of the physical system as a quaternion, it would be too much work to figure out where a star tracker is oriented from star coordinates, right?
