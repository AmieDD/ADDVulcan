Timeout, Bye
```

All of the numbers are within the range [0, 255], so I went ahead and
guessed that these were 8-bit values.
I loaded the data into Python as a 2D list:

```python
data = [
[1,5,9,3,2,4,6,9...],
[3,1,2,2,3,0,7,4...],
...
]
```

It looked like the dimensions of the image data were 128x128, which led
me to believe that the image was greyscale - there wouldn't be a whole
lot of resolution if it were anything else.

I used [`pillow`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to load the
data in as an 8 bit-per-pixel (8bpp) greyscale image and write it back
out as a PNG:

```python
from PIL import Image

# flatten the data into a byte string
flattened = bytes([pixel for row in data for pixel in row])

# parse the data as a 128x128 image, 8bpp greyscale ('L' mode)
image = Image.frombytes('L', (128, 128), data)
image.save('stars1.png', 'PNG')
```

This gave me a very nice looking set of stars!
This image isn't *quite* correct, but as we'll see shortly, that's alright.

![First image](img/stars1.png)

The problem is asking us to identify localized centers of brightness.
Before writing code to do that, I checked if I was on the right track by
manually grabbing the coordinates of the stars in the highly advanced tool
known as Microsoft Paint:

![Grabbing coordinates in Paint](img/paint.png)

It turns out Paint uses the same coordinate scheme described by the
problem, with pixel (0, 0) in the top-left. All I had to do was hover
over each star with the pixel tool and record the values:

```
12,8
25,44
43,47
78,46
96,50
123,53
98,72
106,88
74,111
49,123
```

(I'd like to mention supersat here, as he'd already gotten and tested
these values a few minutes before I got around to it).

I went to send the values to the server, and...

Hmm. I went back to read the problem description, and I guessed that I had
the X and Y coordinates flipped. Rather than updating my code to handle
this correctly, I decided to flip the coordinates of my answers instead:

![Second image](img/stars2.png)

Success! At this point, I was ready to start writing some code to automate
this, but I noticed that text above the image data: "4 Left...".

Looking at the data I got, I noticed that it was 128x128 again.
I repeated my steps to get the second image, which again had 10 stars -
still easy enough to do by hand. And so I did:

![Third image](img/stars3.png)

Nice! That got me another image, again 128x128 with 10 stars.
I decided to keep going with the manual approach, which was working so far.
I was fully expecting the last image to be enormous or have a large
number of stars - most CTFs I've played in with this style of problem
tend to increase in difficulty or randomize the data to make it impossible
to solve the problem without automation.

But I never ran into a problem.

And after a few minutes, I had a solution I could just paste into the
netcat session:

And with that, I got my reward:

```

I think we've earned a nice break to just sit back and look at the stars:

![* * *](img/stars1.png)
![* * *](img/stars2.png)
![* * *](img/stars3.png)
![* * *](img/stars4.png)
![* * *](img/stars5.png)

I've included some [really bad Python code](./seeing-stars.py)
where I copy-pasted the data for all of the images to generate PNGs.

## Alternative Approaches

Some of my teammates were trying tools I wouldn't have thought to use for
this challenge, and I think it's worthwhile to mention their approaches:

- carfucar loaded the data into Excel and applied conditional formatting.
  I think that this would have worked really well for the manual approach
  I took, and the data is already formatted as a CSV to import it.

  ![Excel](img/excel.png)

- alvarop loaded the data into GNU Octave:

  ![Octave](img/octave.png)
