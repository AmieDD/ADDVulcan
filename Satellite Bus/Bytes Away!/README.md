# Bytes Away!

We have an encrypted telemetry link from one of our satellites but we seem to have lost the encryption key. Thankfully we can still send unencrypted commands using our Cosmos interface (included). I've also included the last version of kit_to.so that was updated to the satellite. Can you help us restore communication with the satellite so we can see what error "flag" is being transmitted?
