The last over-the-space update seems to have broken the housekeeping on our satellite. 
Our satellite's battery is low and is running out of battery fast. 
We have a short flyover window to transmit a patch or it'll be lost forever. 
The battery level is critical enough that even the task scheduling server has shutdown. 
Thankfully can be fixed without without any exploit knowledge by using the built in APIs provied by https://www.kubos.com.
Hopefully we can save this one!

Note: When you're done planning, go to low power mode to wait for the next transmission window
