    The rope memory in the Apollo Guidance Computer experienced an unintended 'tangle' just 
prior to launch. While Buzz Aldrin was messing around with the docking radar and making Neil
nervous; he noticed the value of PI was slightly off but wasnâ€™t exactly sure by how much. It
seems that it was changed to something slightly off 3.14 although still 3 point something. 
The Commanche055 software on the AGC stored the value of PI under the name "PI/16", and 
although it has always been stored in a list of constants, the exact number of constants in 
that memory region has changed with time.

    Help Buzz tell ground control the floating point value PI by connecting your DSKY to the
AGC Commanche055 instance that is listening at 3.15.213.229:11884

What is the floating point value of PI?:
